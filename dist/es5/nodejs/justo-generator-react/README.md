## Install

Observations:

- An immutable component is a stateless component.
- A mutable component is a stateful component.

## Adding Flux-specific folders (Flux)

This command must be executed after `justo -g react` for creating the *Flux*-specific folders and files:

```
justo -g react flux
```

## Adding action file (Flux)

```
justo -g react flux action file
```

## Adding action to action file (Flux)

You can add an action and its creator method using this command:

```
justo -g react flux action
```

## Adding React component (Flux)

When the *React* component accesses a store, you must use this command, instead of `component`:
